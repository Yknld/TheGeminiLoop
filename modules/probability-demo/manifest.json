The second slider, labeled 'Total Number of Possible Outcomes', should range from 1 to 10 (and always be greater than or equal to the 'Favorable Outcomes' slider's value). As the user adjusts these sliders, dynamically update and display the probability as a simplified fraction, a decimal (to two places), and a percentage. For example, if Favorable is 1 and Total is 2, it should show '1/2', '0.50', '50%'.
