          "explanation": "The equation $2x + 5 = 13$ can be thought of as a balanced scale, where the expression on the left side, $2x + 5$, has the same 'weight' as the number on the right side, $13$. Our goal is to find the value of $x$ that makes this true.",

          "audioExplanation": "This visualization helps you understand that an equation is like a perfectly balanced scale. What you do to one side, you must do to the other to keep it balanced. The interactive module shows a balance scale where the left side has '2x + 5' and the right side has '13'. This helps you visualize the concept of equality and the goal of solving for $x$ by seeing it as finding what $x$ must be to keep the scale level.",

          "modulePrompt": "Visualize a classic two-pan balance scale. On the left pan, represent the expression '2x + 5'. This should be shown as two distinct blocks, each labeled 'x', and five smaller unit blocks, each labeled '1'. On the right pan, represent the number '13' as thirteen individual unit blocks, each labeled '1'. The scale should be depicted as perfectly balanced. Below the scale, display the algebraic equation '$2x + 5 = 13$' clearly. There should be no interactive elements in this initial step, as its purpose is solely to establish the visual analogy of an equation as a balanced system, illustrating what the given problem conceptually looks like.",

          "explanation": "To start isolating $x$, we need to remove the constant term, $+5$, from the left side of the equation. To maintain balance, whatever operation we perform on one side, we must also perform on the other side. Think about the balance scale: if you remove weight from one side, you must remove the same weight from the other side to keep it level.",

          "audioExplanation": "This step shows you how to begin isolating $x$ by removing constants from the equation. You must keep the balance scale perfectly balanced at all times to maintain equality. The visualization displays the balance scale with '2x + 5' on the left and '13' on the right. Below it, you'll see the equation '$2x + 5 = 13$'. You can interactively 'remove' 5 units from both sides, helping you understand that to undo an addition, you subtract, and that this action must be applied equally to both sides to maintain equilibrium.",

When this button is clicked, animate 5 '1' unit blocks disappearing from the left pan and, simultaneously, 5 '1' unit blocks disappearing from the right pan. The scale should visually dip slightly then re-balance to indicate the change. Update the equation displayed below the scale in two phases: first to '$2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5$', then immediately to the simplified form '$2x = 8$'. The primary purpose of this module is to visually demonstrate the concept of performing the same operation on both sides of an equation to maintain equality and begin isolating the variable.",

You can observe the balance scale with the reduced number of unit blocks on both sides, which visually confirms the simplified equation.

Just as before, any action taken on one side of the equation must be mirrored on the other to keep the equation balanced. The visualization shows the balance scale with '2x' on the left and '8' on the right. Below, you see '$2x = 8$'. You can interactively 'divide' the items on both sides by 2, which helps you understand that to undo multiplication, you must divide, and this operation, too, must be applied equally to both sides to maintain equality.",

Simultaneously, animate the '8' on the right pan splitting into two equal groups of four '1' unit blocks each. Then, visually remove one 'x' block and one corresponding group of four '1' unit blocks from the scale (representing taking half of each side). Show the scale momentarily dip then re-balance.

You can now clearly see one 'x' block balanced by four '1' unit blocks. The interactive module displays the balance scale in its final state, with a single 'x' block on the left pan and four '1' unit blocks on the right pan, perfectly balanced.
