          "explanation": "Addition is a fundamental arithmetic operation that combines two or more numbers (called addends) to find their total sum. When you see a '+' sign between two numbers, it means you are putting them together or finding how many there are in total after combining them. For instance, if you have 3 apples and then you get 5 more apples, addition helps you figure out the total number of apples you now have.",

You can use the sliders to represent different numbers, and you'll see how combining those groups visually results in a larger total. This module is an interactive counter that shows two separate groups of items, allowing you to adjust the quantity in each group with sliders. When you 'combine' them, it animates the items merging into one larger group, visually representing the sum. This helps you grasp that addition is about bringing quantities together.",

Below each container, there should be a slider allowing the user to adjust the number of circles in that container (range 0 to 10). A prominent button labeled 'Combine' should be present. When the 'Combine' button is clicked, animate the circles from Container B smoothly moving into Container A, so all circles are now merged within Container A. The combined total number of circles should be displayed prominently as 'Total: [number]' below Container A. This visualization helps you understand that addition means physically combining two quantities to find a new total, showing that $3 + 5$ means taking 3 items and physically adding 5 more to them to count the entirety.",

Then, it visually animates 5 jumps (each jump represented by a small arrow or arc) moving to the right from '3'. The final landing point on the number line, '8', is highlighted with a red dot.
