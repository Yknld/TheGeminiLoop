          "audioExplanation": "In this first step, you need to identify the starting quantity for our subtraction problem. The visualization will help you see this by presenting a clear count of the initial number of items. This helps you visually anchor the concept of the number you are beginning with, making it concrete before any operation is performed. The visualization shows seven blue circles arranged in a row, clearly representing the initial value of $7$ in the problem.",
          "visualizationType": "interactive",
          "modulePrompt": "Create an interactive module that visually represents the starting quantity of $7$. Display seven distinct, identical blue circles (hex code #3b82f6) arranged horizontally with small gaps between them. Each circle should be clearly visible. There should be a static label above the circles that says 'Starting Quantity: 7'. The user should not interact with these circles yet; they are only for observation to establish the initial set. This module aims to visually and conceptually establish the number $7$, the first number in our subtraction problem.",

          "audioExplanation": "Now that you've identified the starting amount, this step focuses on the 'taking away' part of subtraction. The interactive visualization helps you understand this by letting you physically remove items from the initial set. This direct action makes the concept of subtraction much more intuitive than just seeing numbers. The visualization displays the initial seven blue circles, and you can click on any three of them, which will then visually fade out or disappear, representing the act of subtracting $3$ items.",

          "modulePrompt": "Continue from the previous visualization. Display the initial seven blue circles (hex code #3b82f6) arranged horizontally. Add a clear instruction text above the circles: 'Click on 3 circles to take them away'. Make each circle clickable. When a circle is clicked, it should visually transform to a light grey color (hex code #d1d5db) and become semi-transparent (e.g., 30% opacity) to indicate it has been 'removed' or 'taken away', but still visible to show the initial count. The user can only click up to three circles. Once three circles are clicked, disable further clicks on the remaining blue circles. This module visualizes the operation of subtracting $3$ by allowing the user to actively remove three items from the starting collection of seven.",

          "audioExplanation": "In this final step, you'll find the answer to the subtraction problem by counting the objects that remain after the 'taking away' action. The visualization makes this very straightforward by showing only the items that are left and distinguishing them clearly from the removed items. This helps you directly see and count the result, reinforcing the meaning of subtraction as finding 'what's left'. The visualization shows the four remaining active blue circles clearly, allowing you to easily count them to determine the final answer of $4$.",

Display all seven circles, with the three 'taken away' circles in light grey and semi-transparent, and the four remaining active circles in their original blue (hex code #3b82f6) and fully opaque. Add a clear instruction above: 'Count the active blue circles to find the answer.' The module should clearly highlight the four active blue circles, perhaps by giving them a subtle, continuous pulse or a slightly larger size, to draw the user's attention to them for counting. This module helps the user determine the final answer by visually isolating and presenting the count of the remaining items, solidifying the concept that subtraction yields the difference.",

          "audioExplanation": "This step helps you understand that multiplication isn't just a mysterious operation; it's a shortcut for adding the same number multiple times. The visualization clearly shows how '4 times 2' translates directly into laying out four distinct groups, each containing two items. Seeing the objects physically arranged like this helps you grasp the fundamental meaning of 'times' as repeated grouping. The module is an interactive display of groups of objects that helps you visualize what 'repeated addition' means by showing multiple sets of the same quantity.",
          "visualizationType": "interactive",
          "modulePrompt": "Display a canvas with distinct groups of circular objects. Initially, show four groups, with two identical blue spheres in each group. Arrange these groups horizontally with clear spacing between them. Above each group, display the number '2' in a small label. Below the entire arrangement, display the repeated addition expression '2 + 2 + 2 + 2'. Include two sliders: one labeled 'Number of Groups' (range 1-10) and another labeled 'Items per Group' (range 1-10). As the user adjusts these sliders, the visual representation should update in real-time: the number of groups of spheres will change, and the number of spheres within each group will change accordingly. The repeated addition expression displayed below the spheres should also dynamically update to reflect the current configuration (e.g., if set to 3 groups of 5 items, it shows '5 + 5 + 5'). This interactive module helps visualize what 'multiplication as repeated addition' fundamentally means by allowing you to dynamically build and observe different repeated addition scenarios.",

          "audioExplanation": "In this step, the interactive visualization brings the concept of repeated addition to life by allowing you to actively engage with the counting process. When you activate the 'Count' feature, you'll see the individual items physically combining, making the summation process very concrete. This visual and animated counting reinforces how combining equal groups leads to a total. The module is an animation that shows individual items being gathered and counted, helping you to concretely visualize the process of summation from repeated addition.",

          "modulePrompt": "Start with the visual from the previous step showing four groups, each containing two identical blue spheres, arranged horizontally. Below, display the expression '2 + 2 + 2 + 2'. Add a prominent 'Count Total' button. When the 'Count Total' button is clicked, an animation sequence should begin: first, the spheres from each group individually detach slightly, then all spheres smoothly move towards a central point on the canvas. As they converge, they should form a single, larger cluster. Simultaneously, a large digital counter should appear above the cluster, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1 for each sphere that joins the central cluster until it reaches the total of 8. Once the animation is complete and the counter shows 8, display the final numerical sum '8' clearly below the combined cluster. This interactive module visually demonstrates the physical act of summing all the items from the repeated groups.",

          "audioExplanation": "This final step connects your understanding of repeated addition directly to the multiplication operation. The visualization confirms the result you found through counting and addition by presenting the mathematical equation alongside a clear visual array. Seeing the numerical expression $4 \\times 2 = 8$ directly linked to the physical count helps solidify the relationship between abstract multiplication and concrete quantities. This module is an interactive display of an array of objects that helps you visualize the product of the multiplication by showing the total quantity arranged in a grid, directly connecting the equation to the count.",

          "modulePrompt": "Display the multiplication equation '$4 \\times 2 = ?$' prominently at the top of the canvas. Below this, display a grid of 8 small blue spheres arranged in 4 rows and 2 columns. Each row should be slightly visually distinct (e.g., a faint line separating rows, or rows slightly staggered) to emphasize the '4 groups' aspect. Have a 'Show Product' button. When clicked, the '?' in the equation should animate to reveal '8', so the equation becomes '$4 \\times 2 = 8$'. Simultaneously, the entire 4x2 array of 8 spheres should briefly glow or flash to highlight the total.
